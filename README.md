Open-source educational app to empower teachers and students in Iran


🌍 Call for Volunteers: Open Source Educational App for Schools in Iran

Hello everyone,  
I am an educator from Iran working on a project to modernize schools with a **digital portfolio app**. The goal is to empower teachers and students with a simple, localized, and accessible tool that connects to **Google Drive / Google Sheets** for managing homework, attendance, and creative projects.

🎯 Why this project matters:
- Many schools in Iran lack affordable digital tools.
- Existing platforms are expensive or blocked due to sanctions.
- A free, open-source solution can make education more inclusive and modern.

💡 What we need:
- Volunteer developers (Flutter, React Native, Node.js, Python).
- Contributors for integration with Google APIs (Drive, Sheets).
- Designers to help with UI/UX for Persian-speaking classrooms.
- Anyone passionate about **open source + education**.

✅ What you get:
- Your name and contribution listed publicly (great for your portfolio).
- Real-world impact: helping thousands of students and teachers.
- Experience in building an edtech product from scratch.

Together, we can build something meaningful and open source for education! 🚀
